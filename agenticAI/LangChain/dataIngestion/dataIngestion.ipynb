The company was founded in 1916 as a manufacturer of aircraft engines, which it produced from 1917 to 1918 and again from 1933 to 1945, creating engines for aircraft that were used in the Second World War.\\n\\nThe company\\'s automobiles are marketed under the BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce brands, and motorcycles are marketed under the BMW Motorrad brand. In 2023, BMW was the world\\'s ninth-largest producer of motor vehicles, and the 6th largest by revenue,[4] with 2,555,341 vehicles produced in that year alone.[5] In 2023, the company was ranked 46th in the Forbes Global 2000.[6] The company has significant motor-sport history, especially in touring cars, sports cars, and the Isle of Man TT.\\n\\nBMW is headquartered in Munich and produces motor vehicles in Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, India, China, and previously also in the Netherlands (ceased in 2023).[7] The Quandt family [de] is a long-term shareholder of the company, following investments by the brothers Herbert and Harald Quandt in 1959, saved BMW from bankruptcy, with remaining shares owned by the public.\\n\\nHistory\\nMain article: History of BMW\\nThe Otto Flugmaschinenfabrik was founded in 1910 by Gustav Otto in the Kingdom of Bavaria, which was a state of the German Empire. The firm was reorganized on 7 March 1916 into Bayerische Flugzeugwerke AG. This company was then renamed to Bayerische Motoren Werke (BMW) in 1922. However, the name BMW dates back to 1913, when a company using that name was founded by Karl Rapp initially as Rapp Motorenwerke. The name and Rapp Motorenwerke\\'s engine-production assets were transferred to Bayerische Flugzeugwerke in 1922, who adopted the name the same year.[8] BMW\\'s first product was an engine for fighter aircraft of the Luftstreitkräfte. It was a straight-six called the BMW IIIa, designed in the spring of 1917 by engineer Max Friz. Following the end of World War I, BMW remained in business by producing motorcycle engines, agricultural equipment, household items, and railway brakes. The company produced its first motorcycle, the BMW R 32, in 1923.\\n\\nBMW became an automobile manufacturer in 1928 when it purchased Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach, which, at the time, built the Austin 7 under licence from Automobilwerk Eisenach, badged as the Dixi.[9] The first car sold as a BMW was a rebadged Dixi called the BMW 3/15, following BMW\\'s acquisition of the car manufacturer Automobilwerk Eisenach. Throughout the 1930s, BMW expanded its range into sports cars and larger luxury cars.[10][11]\\n\\nAircraft engines, motorcycles, and automobiles would be BMW\\'s main products until World War II. During the war, BMW concentrated on building the BMW 801 aircraft engine using as many as 40,000 slave laborers.[12] These consisted primarily of prisoners from Nazi concentration camps, most prominently Dachau. Motorcycles remained as a side-line and automobile manufacture ceased altogether.\\n\\nBMW\\'s factories were heavily bombed during the war and its remaining West German facilities were banned from producing motor vehicles or aircraft after the war. The company survived by making pots, pans, and bicycles. In 1948, BMW restarted motorcycle production. BMW resumed car production in Bavaria in 1952 with the BMW 501 luxury saloon. The range of cars was expanded in 1955, through the production of the cheaper Isetta microcar under licence. Slow sales of luxury cars and small profit margins from microcars, meant BMW was in serious financial trouble and in 1959 the company was nearly taken over by rival Daimler-Benz.[13][14]\\n\\nA large investment in BMW by Herbert Quandt and Harald Quandt resulted in the company surviving as a separate entity. Günther Quandt was a well-known German industrialist and joined the Nazi party in 1933; he made a fortune arming the German Wehrmacht, manufacturing weapons and batteries.[15] Many of his enterprises were appropriated from Jewish owners under duress with minimal compensation. At least three of his enterprises made extensive use of slave laborers, as many as 50,000 in all.[16] One of his battery factories had its own on-site concentration camp, complete with gallows. Life expectancy for laborers was six months.[16][17] While Quandt and BMW were not directly connected during the war, funds amassed in the Nazi era by his father allowed Herbert Quandt to buy BMW.[12]\\n\\nThe relative success of the small BMW 700 assisted in the company\\'s recovery, allowing them to develop the New Class sedans.\\n\\n\\n1972 BMW 5 Series (1st generation)\\nThe 1962 introduction of the BMW New Class compact sedans was the beginning of BMW\\'s reputation as a leading manufacturer of sport-oriented cars. Throughout the 1960s, BMW expanded its range by adding coupé and luxury sedan models. The BMW 5 Series mid-size sedan range was introduced in 1972, followed by the BMW 3 Series compact sedans in 1975, the BMW 6 Series luxury coupés in 1976 and the BMW 7 Series large luxury sedans in 1978.\\n\\nThe BMW M division released its first road car, the M1, a mid-engine supercar, in 1978. This was followed by the BMW M5 in 1984 and the BMW M3 in 1986. Also in 1986, BMW introduced its first V12 engine in the 750i luxury sedan. The 1989 BMW Z1 marked BMW\\'s return to making a two-seat roadster, the 1995 BMW Z3 was their first mass-production two-seat roadster, and the 1999 BMW X5 was the company\\'s first entry into the SUV market.\\n\\nThe company purchased the Rover Group in 1994, but the takeover was not successful and caused BMW large financial losses. In 2000, BMW sold off most of the Rover brands, retaining only the Mini brand. In 1998, BMW also acquired the rights to the Rolls-Royce brand from Vickers.\\n\\nThe first modern mass-produced turbocharged petrol engine was introduced in 2006 (from 1973 to 1975, BMW built 1,672 units of a turbocharged BMW M10 engine for the BMW 02 Series),[18] with most engines switching over to turbocharging over the 2010s. The first hybrid BMW was the 2010 BMW ActiveHybrid 7, and BMW\\'s first mass-production electric car was the BMW i3 city car, which was released in 2013, (from 1968 to 1972, BMW built two battery-electric BMW 1602 Elektro saloons for the 1972 Olympic Games).[19] After many years of establishing a reputation for sporting rear-wheel drive cars, BMW\\'s first front-wheel drive car was the 2014 BMW 2 Series Active Tourer multi-purpose vehicle (MPV).\\n\\nIn March 2018, Daimler and BMW merged their mobility services.[20]\\n\\nIn August 2019, Oliver Zipse replaced Harald Krüger as the head of the BMW Group.[21]\\n\\n21st century\\nIn January 2021, BMW announced that its sales in 2020 fell by 8.4 percent due to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. However, in the fourth quarter of 2020, BMW witnessed a rise of 3.2% in its customers\\' demands.[22] This recovery was supported by the company\\'s adoption of widely accepted technologies and integration of third-party services such as Apple Pay and on-demand music as well as key partnerships such as its collaboration with Daimler on autonomous driving.[23][24] Additionally, BMW\\'s strategic investment decisions which include localizing production of its SUVs to the Spartanburg plant in the U.S., placed the group in a position to easily navigate trade challenges and shifting consumer patterns.[23]\\n\\nOn 18 January 2022 BMW announced a BMW 7 Series (G11) special edition simply called \"The Final V12\",[25] the last BMW series production vehicle to be fitted with a V-12 engine.[25]\\n\\nOn 5 October 2023 it was announced that BMW UK CEO Chris Brownridge would succeed Torsten Müller-Ötvös as the CEO of Rolls-Royce starting 1 December 2023, as a result of Müller-Ötvös retiring.[26]\\n\\nBranding\\n\\nBMW badge on a 1931 Dixi\\n\\nFlag of Bavaria\\n\\n1970 BMW 2002ti Garmisch concept\\nCompany name\\nBMW is an abbreviation for Bayerische Motoren Werke. This name is grammatically incorrect (in German, compound words must not contain spaces), which is why the grammatically correct form of the name, Bayerische Motorenwerke (German pronunciation: [ˈbaɪʁɪʃə moˈtoːʁənˌvɛʁkə] ⓘ) has been used in several publications and advertisements in the past.[27][28] Bayerische Motorenwerke translates into English as Bavarian Motor Works.[29] The suffix AG, short for Aktiengesellschaft, signifies an incorporated entity owned by shareholders, thus akin to \"Inc.\" (US) or PLC, \"Public Limited Company\" (UK).\\n\\nThe terms Beemer, Bimmer and Bee-em are sometimes used as slang for BMW in the English language[30][31] and are sometimes used interchangeably for cars and motorcycles.[32][33][34]\\n\\nLogo\\nThe circular blue and white BMW logo or roundel evolved from the circular Rapp Motorenwerke company logo, which featured a black ring bearing the company name surrounding the company logo,[35] an image of a horse head on a plinth. BMW retained Rapp\\'s black ring inscribed with the company name, but the interior of the ring is quartered blue and white, reminiscent of the coat of arms and flag of Bavaria (which in turn are based on the arms of the historic House of Wittelsbach, which ruled Bavaria for many centuries).[35] The logo does not bear the distinctive lozenge shape found on the coat of arms, however, as local laws at the time it was introduced forbade the use of state coats of arms on commercial logos.[36]\\n\\nA persistent myth claims that the logo is based on the image of an airplane propeller spinning in a blue sky. This myth likely stems from a 1929 BMW advertisement that depicted the logo superimposed on a rotating propeller. However, the logo predates that advertisement by 12 years.[35][37]\\n\\nThe current iteration of the logo was introduced in 2020,[38] removing 3D effects that had been used in previous renderings of the logo while removing the black outline encircling the rondel. The logo is used for BMW\\'s branding communications but it is not used on vehicles.[39][40]')]"

Their first successful motorcycle after the failed Helios and Flink, was the \"R32\" in 1923, though production originally began in 1921.[52] This had a \"boxer\" twin engine, in which a cylinder projects into the air-flow from each side of the machine. Apart from their single-cylinder models (basically to the same pattern), all their motorcycles used this distinctive layout until the early 1980s. Many BMW\\'s are still produced in this layout, which is designated the R Series.\\nThe entire BMW Motorcycle production has, since 1969, been located at the company\\'s Berlin-Spandau factory.\\nDuring the Second World War, BMW produced the BMW R75 motorcycle with a motor-driven sidecar attached, combined with a lockable differential, this made the vehicle very capable off-road.[53]\\nIn 1982, came the K Series, shaft drive but water-cooled and with either three or four cylinders mounted in a straight line from front to back. Shortly after, BMW also started making the chain-driven F and G series with single and parallel twin Rotax engines.\\nIn the early 1990s, BMW updated the airhead Boxer engine which became known as the oilhead. In 2002, the oilhead engine had two spark plugs per cylinder. In 2004 it added a built-in balance shaft, an increased capacity to 1,170\\xa0cc (71\\xa0cu\\xa0in) and enhanced performance to 75\\xa0kW (101\\xa0hp) for the R1200GS, compared to 63\\xa0kW (84\\xa0hp) of the previous R1150GS. More powerful variants of the oilhead engines are available in the R1100S and R1200S, producing 73 and 91\\xa0kW (98 and 122\\xa0hp), respectively.\\nIn 2004, BMW introduced the new K1200S Sports Bike which marked a departure for BMW. It had an engine producing 125\\xa0kW (168\\xa0hp), derived from the company\\'s work with the Williams F1 team, and is lighter than previous K models. Innovations include electronically adjustable front and rear suspension, and a Hossack-type front fork that BMW calls Duolever.\\nBMW introduced anti-lock brakes on production motorcycles starting in the late 1980s. The generation of anti-lock brakes available on the 2006 and later BMW motorcycles paved the way for the introduction of electronic stability control, or anti-skid technology later in the 2007 model year.\\nBMW has been an innovator in motorcycle suspension design, taking up telescopic front suspension long before most other manufacturers. Then they switched to an Earles fork, front suspension by swinging fork (1955 to 1969). Most modern BMWs are truly rear swingarm, single sided at the back (compare with the regular swinging fork usually, and wrongly, called swinging arm). Some BMWs started using yet another trademark front suspension design, the Telelever, in the early 1990s. Like the Earles fork, the Telelever significantly reduces dive under braking.[54]\\nBMW Group, on 31 January 2013, announced that Pierer Industrie AG has bought Husqvarna Motorcycles for an undisclosed amount, which will not be revealed by either party in the future. The company is headed by Stephan Pierer (CEO of KTM). Pierer Industrie AG is 51% owner of KTM and 100% owner of Husqvarna.\\nIn September 2018, BMW unveiled a new self-driving motorcycle with BMW Motorrad with a goal of using the technology to help improve road safety.[55] The design of the bike was inspired by the company\\'s BMW R1200 GS model.[56]\\n\\nAutomobiles[edit]\\nCurrent models[edit]\\nSee also: List of BMW vehicles, Mini (marque), and Rolls-Royce Motor Cars\\nThe current model lines of BMW cars are:\\n\\n1 Series five-door hatchbacks (model code F70).\\n2 Series two-door coupes (model code G42), \"Active Tourer\" five-seat MPVs (U06), four-door \"Gran Coupe\" sedans (model code F74) and long-wheelbase model exclusive to China (F78).\\n3 Series four-door sedans (model code G20), five-door station wagons (G21) and long-wheelbase model exclusive to China (G28).\\n4 Series two-door coupes (model code G22), two-door convertibles (model code G23) and five-door \"Gran Coupe\" fastbacks (model code G26).\\n5 Series four-door sedans (model code G60), five-door station wagons (G61) and long-wheelbase model exclusive to China (G68).\\n7 Series four-door sedans (model code G70).\\n8 Series two-door convertibles (model code G14), two-door coupes (G15) and four-door \"Gran Coupe\" sedans (G16).\\n\\n\\n\\n1 Series (F70)\\n\\n\\n\\n2 Series Gran Coupé (F74)\\n\\n\\n\\n2 Series (G42)\\n\\n\\n\\n3 Series (G20)\\n\\n\\n\\n4 Series (G22)\\n\\n\\n\\n5 Series (G60)\\n\\n\\n\\n7 Series (G70)\\n\\n\\n\\n8 Series (G15)\\n\\n\\nThe current model lines of the X Series SUVs and crossovers are:\\n\\nX1 (U11)\\nX2 (U10)\\nX3 (G45)\\nX4 (G02)\\nX5 (G05)\\nX6 (G06)\\nX7 (G07)\\nXM (G09)\\n\\n\\n\\nX1 (U11)\\n\\n\\n\\nX2 (U10)\\n\\n\\n\\nX3 (G45)\\n\\n\\n\\nX4 (G02)\\n\\n\\n\\nX5 (G05)\\n\\n\\n\\nX6 (G06)\\n\\n\\n\\nX7 (G07)\\n\\n\\n\\nXM (G09)\\n\\n\\nThe current model line of the Z Series two-door roadsters is the Z4 (model code G29).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nZ4 (G29)\\n\\n\\ni models[edit]\\nMain article: BMW i\\nAll-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles are sold under the BMW i sub-brand.

The complex frequencies\\nthat compose the ringdown spectrum observed at the last\\nstage of BH merger, commonly described by BH pertur-\\nbation theory [5, 6], would correspond to quasinormal\\nmodes intuitively interpreted as damped oscillations of\\nthe spacetime, confined around the photon sphere (PS)\\nof the BH [5, 7, 8]. The PS is a spherical region outside\\nthe BH, where spacetime is so extremely warped that\\nlight trajectories bend and get trapped in a circular orbit\\naround the BH. Orbiting light rays with impact param-\\neters slightly departing from the photon capture radius\\n[9], will either get bent away from or engulfed into the\\nBH. The instability of this classical circular orbit raises\\na fundamental question: If this region is unstable, why\\nshould a gravitational mode be localized, or ”scarred,”\\naround it? This challenge calls for a more precise charac-\\nterization of these damped modes, including their spatial\\ndistribution.\\nIn a controlled laboratory environment analog models\\nof general relativity could serve as a platform to track\\ndown PS and light dynamics thereabouts. For instance,\\nartificial optical materials have been used to achieve\\n∗patrick.sebbah@biu.ac.il\\n[§] These authors contributed equally to this work.\\nlight bending [10], wavefront shaping [11] and optical\\ntrapping [12], with the index profiles derived from care-\\nfully engineered metrics [13]. Another table-top analog\\nmodel of gravitational fields consists of a two-dimensional\\n(2D) curved surfaces embedded in three-dimensional\\n(3D) space [14, 15], which are derived by considering a\\nfixed time coordinate in the four-dimensional (4D) curved\\nspacetime. Based on this static projection, various opti-\\ncal phenomena have been investigated both theoretically\\nand experimentally [16–24]. However, removing the time\\ncoordinate by setting time as a constant does not preserve\\nthe geodesics in the original 4D black hole spacetime.\\nThis calls for a more faithful projection that conserves\\nthe Fermat principle of least time.\\nIn this work, we address this question using the Fermat\\nmetric, establishing a rigorous analogy between the four-\\ndimensional spacetime metric and a two-dimensional\\ncurved surface that faithfully preserves the original four-\\ndimensional lightlike geodesics.\\nFrom there we design\\nthe 2D surface of revolution associated with the non-\\nrotational uncharged Schwarzschild black hole. Because\\nscalar fields in curved spacetime and electromagnetic\\nfields on curved surface share the same equation, namely\\nthe Klein-Gordon equation, it is possible to mimic the\\nquasinormal modes of ringing BHs on curved optical mi-\\ncrocavities, when their dimensions become comparable to\\nthe optical wavelength, far beyond the geometric optics\\nlimit explored in earlier works.\\nIn microcavities and microlasers, resonant modes have\\ntheir backbone along periodic orbits. A famed instance is\\nthe whispering gallery modes (WGMs), whose ray coun-\\nterparts undergo polygonal orbits by total internal re-\\nflection along the circular boundary.\\nRecently, Song\\net al. constructed non-Euclidean microlaser cavities on\\na M¨obius strip, and experimentally demonstrated that\\n2\\nmodes are only sustained on periodic orbits [25]. In these\\ncases, light is confined in the cavity through total internal\\nreflection, with the underlying periodic ray orbit neces-\\nsarily colliding on the boundary.\\nHere we show that in non-Euclidean geometry, the spa-\\ntial curvature may provide a radically different confin-\\ning mechanism based on an effective “surface potential”\\n[26], which can possibly trap light without involvement of\\nouter boundaries. High-Q bottle micro-resonators based\\non this concept have been demonstrated on optical glass\\nfiber, with modes localizing on a bulge area [27].

(7) in a sandwich structure of air-surface-\\nair. For the purpose of modeling, we assume that the ra-\\ndiation emitted from the boundary of the Schwarzschild\\ncavity is distributed along a truncated cone, whose slope\\nis tangent to its generatrix, as depicted by regions I and\\nIII in Fig. 2(a). This assumption is intuitive, as the ro-\\ntational symmetry of the Schwarzschild surface ensures\\nthat radiation follows its longitudes, which form natural\\npaths in flat space. Additionally, the Gaussian curvature\\nof cones is zero, similar to flat space. A general cone can\\nbe described by the metric\\nds2\\ncone =\\n\\x001 + κ2\\x01\\ndϱ2 + ϱ2dφ2,\\nwhere ϱ represents the radius of revolution, and κ denotes\\nthe slope. The eigenfrequency spectrum of the entire sys-\\ntem can be determined by matching the different regions\\nwith appropriate interface conditions. In this work, we\\nfocus on transverse magnetic modes, where Ψ represents\\nthe component of the electric field perpendicular to the\\nsurface at each point. Both Ψ and its first derivative are\\ncontinuous across the I-II and II-III interfaces.\\nWe apply the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) ap-\\nproximation to solve the Schr¨odinger-like Eq. (7) [36].\\nThis method yields oscillatory solutions when the spa-\\ntially varying coefficient Qs(ρ) > 0 (represented by the\\nhatched areas in Fig. 2(b)) and produces exponentially\\ndecaying or diverging solutions when Qs(ρ) < 0.\\nThe\\npoints where Qs(ρ) = 0 are known as turning points,\\nwhere the WKB approximation breaks down.\\nIn such\\ncases, the modified Airy function method can be em-\\nployed, as it effectively handles the behavior at turning\\npoints [37]. The sign of Qs(ρ) at any given position ρ is\\n5\\ndetermined by the variable k. To facilitate comparison,\\nwe define an effective potential from Eq. (8) as follows:\\nVeff(ρ) ≡\\n\\x12\\nl2 + 1\\n2\\n\\x13 \\x12 1\\nρ2 −rs\\nρ3\\n\\x13\\n−3\\n16\\n\\x122\\nρ −rs\\nρ2\\n\\x132\\n, (9)\\ndrawing an analogy with the potential in quantum me-\\nchanical systems. As illustrated in Fig. 2(b), the effec-\\ntive potential Veff on the Schwarzschild surface resembles\\na hill, with its peak precisely located at the PS. Con-\\nversely, in both tangent cones, Veff decreases as the dis-\\ntance from the I-II and II-III interfaces increases. It is im-\\nportant to note that our approach follows the “modes-of-\\nthe-universe” framework [38], where the field is quantized\\nwithin the Schwarzschild cavity and its tangent truncated\\ncones. Since energy is conserved throughout the system,\\nthe corresponding wavenumbers k are real.\\nTo begin, we search for eigenmodes where k2\\n>\\nV (II)\\neff\\n(ρPS), which corresponds to the case of Fig. 2\\n(b2).\\nIn this case, we also restrict k2 such that k2 <\\nmin\\n\\x10\\nV (I)\\neff (ρB1), V (III)\\neff\\n(ρB2)\\n\\x11\\n, ensuring the presence of\\nturning points in both Region I and Region III. These\\nturning points divide each region into a decaying area\\n(towards the interface) and an oscillatory area (extend-\\ning towards infinity). As a consequence, QNMs are more\\nconfined between the interfaces, and thus more promis-\\ning for experimental demonstration. The wave function\\nin the cavity (region II) can be written as\\nψ(II) (ρ) = C2+ϕ2+(ρ) + C2−ϕ2−(ρ),\\n(10)\\nwhere\\nϕ2±(ρ) =\\nh\\nQ(II)\\ns\\n(ρ)\\ni−1\\n4 exp\\n\\x12\\n±i\\nZ ρ\\nρB1\\nq\\nQ(II)\\ns\\n(ρ′)dρ′\\n\\x13\\n,\\n(11)\\nand C2+ and C2−are to-be-determined constant coeffi-\\ncients.\\nThe stitch of the wave function in these three\\nregions, along with to-be-determined coefficients, can be\\nwritten in matrix form as (see the Method section)\\nM\\n\\uf8eb\\n\\uf8ec\\n\\uf8ed\\nC1\\nC2+\\nC2−\\nC3\\n\\uf8f6\\n\\uf8f7\\n\\uf8f8= 0,\\n(12)\\nwith C1 and C3 being the coefficients in Region I and\\nIII of the outgoing wave function.\\nTo obtain nontriv-\\nial solutions, the determinant of the matrix must vanish,\\ni.e., det (M) = 0. As k is the only variable in matrix\\nM, eigen-wave numbers are the zeros of det (M), rep-\\nresented as sharp dips in Fig. 2(c). Given l = 25, four\\nsolutions are found in the green area of Fig. 2(c), as-\\nsociated with modes confined by the effective potential\\nwithin the Schwarzschild cavity. The first mode is shown\\nin Fig. 2(e) and (g), with maximum intensity near the\\nPS. We identify this mode as the fundamental PS mode.\\nIndeed, the envelope of PS modes in Eq.

PS modes can no longer be sustained\\nas the PS falls in the decaying area. Instead, oscillating\\nareas are situated near the two boundaries, resulting in\\nthe corresponding quasinormal modes akin to WGMs. A\\ntypical WGM solution of Eq. (10) is shown in Fig. 2(d)\\nand (f) for comparison. We show in Supplementary In-\\nformation Fig. S3 the wave functions of all five WGM\\nsolutions found in the purple region of Fig. 2(c).\\nD.\\nNumerical simulations of quasi-normal modes\\nTo test our theoretical prediction, we perform finite\\ndifferential time domain (FDTD) simulations and numer-\\nically exhibit the eigenmodes in the Schwarzschild cav-\\nity. As 3D surfaces could be computationally expensive,\\nhere, the simulation is implemented instead in its confor-\\nmally transformed 2D plane [41]. Thus the Schwarzschild\\ncavity is represented by a disk with radius 5 µm and a\\nradially varying discretized index of refraction. Perfectly\\nmatched layers (PML) surround the simulated area, act-\\ning as the open boundary at the inteface II-III. A TM-\\npolarized pulse with central frequency 210 THz (corre-\\nsponding to wavelength 1.4 µm) and pulse length 30 fs is\\napplied, and the temporal evolution of the electric field\\nis recorded at different positions.

The Q fac-\\ntors for different families of mode are shown in Fig. 3(d)\\nas a function of their azimutal number, l. The Q factors\\nof the PS mode family are lower than those of the first-\\norder WGM. This difference arises because WGMs are\\nstrongly confined near the outer boundary by total inter-\\nnal reflection, whereas the potential-induced confinement\\nof PSMs does not fully suppress their radiation loss from\\nthe truncated structure, as shown in Fig. 3(b1). Nev-\\nertheless, the Q factors of PS modes are comparable to\\nor even exceed those of higher-order WGMs (Fig. 3(d)),\\nhighlighting the effectiveness of curvature-induced light\\nconfinement in the propagation layer.\\nIII.\\nEXPERIMENTAL DEMONSTRATION\\nWe now proceed to experimentally validate our theo-\\nretical predictions on the existence of modes at the PS.\\nThe Schwarzschild surface is fabricated using advanced\\n3D direct laser writing, utilizing Nanoscribe’s two-photon\\npolymerization technology.\\nGiven the relatively short-\\nlived nature of the predicted optical quasinormal modes,\\nwe propose investigating the corresponding lasing modes\\nin a dye-doped organic structure.

To enhance the like-\\nlihood of observing PS lasing modes, we propose to\\npump the microcavity locally, near the PS, away from\\nthe edges where WGMs are predominantly confined. Se-\\nlective pumping has been proposed earlier to selectively\\nexcite lasing modes and achieve single mode lasing in\\nrandom lasers [44].\\nThe pump intensity profile of a\\nfrequency-doubled Q-switched Nd:YAG laser at 532 nm\\nis shaped by reflection on a spatial light modulator into\\na 4 µm-wide and 95 µm-long narrow stripe positioned at\\nthe waist, as shown in Fig. 4(a). The top view of the\\nstructure with the pump stripe aligned along the waist is\\nshown in the inset of Fig. 4(b). At sufficiently high pump\\nenergy, multimode laser emission is observed. The emis-\\nsion spectrum is recorded and shown in Fig. 4(b). To\\nidentify periodic features in this spectrum, we applied\\nthe Lomb-Scargle algorithm commonly used to charac-\\nterize periodicity in unevenly-sampled series. The result-\\ning Fourier-like power spectrum is shown in Fig. 4(c).\\nEach peak in the first group corresponds to a family of\\nspectrally regularly-spaced modes confined on a partic-\\nular orbit with optical path length nL.

PS lasing is directly observed under the mi-\\ncroscope, as shown in Fig. 4(d), where two lasing spots\\nare seen precisely at the location of the PS.\\nThe two additional peaks seen in the Lomb-Scargle\\nperiodogram at nL2 = 237 µm and nL3 = 268 µm are\\nidentified as modes on circular orbits with D2 = 48.4 µm\\nand D3 = 54.7 µm. These modes are confined near the\\nsample edges, at DL =48.9 ±1 µm and DR = 60.0 ±1\\nµm, and are believed to be WGMs. This is confirmed by\\nmoving the pump strip to the positions of these modes.\\nFor instance, Fig. 4(f) and 4(g) respectively shows the\\nemission spectrum and the periodogram when pumping\\nnear the position of orbit L3. The position of the pump\\nstripe on the structure is shown in Fig. 4(e) and in the\\ninset of Fig. 4(f). Only the third peak at nL3 = 268 µm\\nremains in the periodogram, characterizing the periodic\\nstructure of the emission spectrum shown in Fig. 4(f).\\nAs anticipated, the lasing spots at the PS have vanished\\nas can be seen in Fig. 4(h). When the pump is moved to\\nother positions, additional WGMs are observed near the\\nsample edges (not shown), corresponding to higher-order\\nWGMs, as predicted by theory (see Fig. S2 in Supple-\\nmentary Information).\\nIn contrast to selective excitation, uniform pumping\\nof the microcavity laser would be dominated by WGMs.\\nThe emission spectrum with a 50 µm-wide and 95 µm-\\nlong rectangular pump profile (Fig. 4(i)) is presented in\\nFig. 4(j). The corresponding Lomb-Scargle periodogram\\n(Fig. 4(k)) reveals a dominant peak at 268 µm corre-\\nsponding to the previously identified WGM. A feeble sig-\\nnature of the PS mode and the WGM confined near the\\nsample edge at DL =48.9 ±1 is also present. An image of\\nthe lasing microcavity under uniform pumping is shown\\nin Fig. 4(l) (see also Fig. 1(e) and Fig. 1(f)).\\nB.\\nPhoton Sphere mode profile measurement\\nWe now focus on a specific PS lasing mode that peaks\\nat 580.3 nm (indicated by the arrow in Fig. 4(b)). The\\npeak intensity as a function of pump energy is shown\\nin Fig. 5(c), indicating a laser threshold of 180 pJ/µm2\\nfor this particular mode.\\nTo characterize the spatial\\ndistribution of this PS mode along the sample axis (z-\\naxis), we record the peak intensity at 580.3 nm as we\\nslide the pump stripe across the sample in steps of 220\\nnm.\\nFew instances of the scanning process are shown\\nin Fig. 5(b). After applying Lucy-Richardson deconvolu-\\ntion, we obtain the spatial distribution of this particular\\n9\\nmode shown in Fig. 5(d). The strong confinement ob-\\nserved around the waist position confirms unequivocally\\nthat the trapping mechanism is driven by the curvature-\\ninduced potential rather than by reflection on the sample\\nedges.\\nThe same scanning process is repeated, but this time,\\nthe peak amplitude at nL1 = 217 µm in the periodogram\\nof Fig. 4(c) corresponding to the family of PS modes is\\nplotted against the pump stripe position (Fig. 5(e)). This\\neffectively performs a weighted spatial averaging over the\\nintensity profile of all PS modes. Remarkably, this mea-\\nsurement aligns closely with our theoretical predictions\\nwhen PS modes are calculated for the actual sample di-\\nmensions and corresponding azimuthal number. The az-\\nimuthal number l in the experiment can be estimated\\nusing the relation πnDW = lλ, where DW is the waist di-\\nameter. We find that l ranges from 371 to 383 for all las-\\ning modes identified in the emission spectrum (Fig. 4(b)).\\nConsidering the average value, l = 377, we then calculate\\nanalytically the corresponding fundamental PS mode and\\ncompare its spatial profile to the measured one (black line\\nin Fig. 5(e)): Excellent agreement in position and spatial\\nextension is obtained between experiment and theory.\\nIV.\\nCONCLUSION\\nTo summarize, we have proposed a dimensionality-\\nreduced optical analog of a 4D Schwarzschild black hole,\\nwhich genuinely preserves its light-like geodesics and\\nshares with it the same governing equations. Our ana-\\nlytical investigation, supported by numerical simulations,\\npredicts the existence of modes at the PS of the opti-\\ncal Schwarzschild surface, and we compute their spectral\\nand spatial characteristics. These QNMs, responsible for\\ngravitational radiations in the universe, are visualized\\nhere for the first time in 3D-printed Schwarzschild laser\\nmicrocavities. Selective pumping allows to discriminate\\nbetween curvature-induced potential-confined PS modes\\nand cavity-trapped WGMs. These modes are confined\\ndue to spatial curvature, rather than cavity boundaries,\\noffering new insights into mode confinement mechanisms.\\nSince the metric in Eq. (1) can take different forms,\\nsuch as by introducing a non-zero cosmological constant,\\nthe quantity and position of PSs can be engineered. This\\npaves the way for designing optical cavities and laser de-\\nvices with novel functionalities.\\nWe believe that black hole analogs, like the one we\\nintroduced, can shed new light on current questions in\\ngravitational physics. In particular, perturbations near\\nthe event horizon offer a way to test Einstein’s theory of\\ngeneral relativity. Here, we present the spatial distribu-\\ntion of the wavefunction, which can be crucial for inves-\\ntigating mode stability [45, 46]. The stability of the ob-\\ntained quasinormal mode spectrum can be further exam-\\nined using methods such as the pseudospectrum approach\\n[45], which is relevant to gravitational-wave analysis [47]\\nand could help in detecting fundamental modes and over-\\ntones [48, 49]. The analog model discussed in this work\\nmay facilitate the study of a wide range of celestial events\\nand phenomena, including black hole spectroscopy [50],\\nLyapunov exponents [51], wave dynamics, Hawking ra-\\ndiation, superradiance, and black hole evaporation [52].\\nThese analog systems also provide physical testbeds for\\nexploring ideas like gravitational wave echoes [53], and\\nin the future, could lead to studies of backreaction and\\nnonlinear QNM interactions [54–58].\\nMethods\\nA.\\nDerivation of coefficient matrix M\\nElements of matrix M are wave functions of each re-\\ngion at the boundaries.

IP-G is used as the Nano-\\nscribe resist and is doped with Pyrromethene 597 (0.5 %\\nwt) to incorporate gain.\\nLaser printing begins within\\nthe glass substrate to securely anchor the microcavity.\\nA dozen of BH microlasers are fabricated on the same\\nglass slide with very good reproducibility. SEM image\\nof a Schwarzschild BH microlaser is shown in Fig. 1(d),\\nFig. 4(a,e,i) and Fig. 5(a). The waist of the structure\\nhas a diameter DW =44.5 ±1 µm. The diameters of the\\nleft (relative to the z-axis defined in Fig. 4(a)) and right\\ncircular edges are DL=49 ±1 µm and DR=60 ±1 µm,\\nrespectively.\\n10\\nC.\\nExperimental setup\\nThe experimental apparatus includes a reflective spa-\\ntial light phase modulator (SLM) (HES 6001 from Holo-\\neye, pixel size 8.0 µm), which serves as a secondary dis-\\nplay for the computer and can receive a grayscale image\\nof the desired shape as needed. To selectively pump spe-\\ncific areas of the laser microcavity, a MATLAB-generated\\nrectangular grayscale image with a uniform value of 255 is\\nsent to the SLM. The pump laser (Ekspla PL2230 with\\nλ = 532 nm, maximum output energy of 28 mJ, pulse\\nduration of 20 ps, repetition rate of 10 Hz) reflects this\\ngrayscale image from the SLM. Furthermore, the SLM\\nrotates the pump laser’s polarization by 90 degrees in re-\\ngions where the grayscale value is non-zero. A polarizer\\npositioned after the SLM is optimized to achieve the cor-\\nresponding amplitude modulation. The pump polariza-\\ntion is aligned with the cavity axis of rotation (z-axis).\\nThe setup also includes two sCMOS cameras, one at-\\ntached to a zoom lens, the other to a fixed-stage micro-\\nscope (Zeiss AxioExaminer A1) for imaging the 3D cavity\\nfrom both the side and the top. The shaped pump beam\\nis directed upward, allowing top imaging under the mi-\\ncroscope to ensure precise alignment of the pump strip\\nperpendicular to the laser microcavity’s axis and to mon-\\nitor mode profile as it is moved along the structure. Las-\\ning emission is collected by a microscope objective (20 ×\\nfrom Thorlabs) connected to a high-resolution imaging\\nspectrometer (iHR550 from Horiba, 2400 mm−1 density\\ngrating, spectral resolution of 20 pm and Synapse cam-\\nera) via a multimode fiber.\\nD.\\nData analysis\\nThe Lomb-Scargle routine of Matlab, plomb.m, has\\nbeen used, which yields a Fourier-like power spectrum,\\nbut with a better accuracy in the peak positions and a\\nbetter signal-to-noise ratio than usual discrete Fourier\\ntransform algorithms.\\nThe Lucy-Richardson deconvolution is a widely used\\nalgorithm for image deblurring.\\nThe routine decon-\\nvlucy.m from Matlab has been used here to improve the\\nresolution of the mode profile, beyond the width of the\\npump stripe.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThis work was done within the C2N micro nanotech-\\nnologies platforms.

The firm was reorganized on 7 March 1916 into Bayerische Flugzeugwerke AG. This company was then renamed to Bayerische Motoren Werke (BMW) in 1922. However, the name BMW dates back to 1913, when a company using that name was founded by Karl Rapp initially as Rapp Motorenwerke. The name and Rapp Motorenwerke's engine-production assets were transferred to Bayerische Flugzeugwerke in 1922, who adopted the name the same year. BMW's first product was an engine for fighter aircraft of the Luftstreitkräfte. It was a straight-six called the BMW IIIa, designed in the spring of 1917 by engineer Max Friz. Following the end of World War I, BMW remained in business by producing motorcycle engines, agricultural equipment, household items, and railway brakes. The company produced its first motorcycle, the BMW R 32, in 1923.\\nBMW became an automobile manufacturer in 1928 when it purchased Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach, which, at the time, built the Austin 7 under licence from Automobilwerk Eisenach, badged as the Dixi. The first car sold as a BMW was a rebadged Dixi called the BMW 3/15, following BMW's acquisition of the car manufacturer Automobilwerk Eisenach. Throughout the 1930s, BMW expanded its range into sports cars and larger luxury cars.\\nAircraft engines, motorcycles, and automobiles would be BMW's main products until World War II. During the war, BMW concentrated on building the BMW 801 aircraft engine using as many as 40,000 slave laborers. These consisted primarily of prisoners from Nazi concentration camps, most prominently Dachau. Motorcycles remained as a side-line and automobile manufacture ceased altogether.\\nBMW's factories were heavily bombed during the war and its remaining West German facilities were banned from producing motor vehicles or aircraft after the war. The company survived by making pots, pans, and bicycles. In 1948, BMW restarted motorcycle production. BMW resumed car production in Bavaria in 1952 with the BMW 501 luxury saloon. The range of cars was expanded in 1955, through the production of the cheaper Isetta microcar under licence. Slow sales of luxury cars and small profit margins from microcars, meant BMW was in serious financial trouble and in 1959 the company was nearly taken over by rival Daimler-Benz.\\nA large investment in BMW by Herbert Quandt and Harald Quandt resulted in the company surviving as a separate entity.

It was presented to the public at the 1985 Frankfurt Motor Show, and began production from March 1986 to June 1991. The E30 M3 was mainly produced in the coupé body style, but limited volumes of convertibles were also produced.\\nThe front splitter, the rear apron, sill panels, as well as changes to the body in the area of the rear window (C-pillar) and the bootlid improved the aerodynamics. For aerodynamic reasons, the rear window was flattened and the tailgate was made of light, glass-reinforced plastic raised by approximately 40 mm for better air flow. The changes over the rear of the car resulted in lower lift forces and better straight-line stability. In addition, the windscreen was glued in – not, as with the other E30 models, framed with a window rubber and piping. As a result, the M3 achieved a relatively low drag coefficient of Cd=0.33 instead of Cd=0.38 as in the standard 3 Series. The only exterior body panels the regular 3 Series and the M3 shared were the bonnet, roof panel, and sunroof.\\nThe brake calipers, discs and master cylinder were unique to the M3 model.\\nThe transmission was a Getrag 265 5-speed manual. European models were outfitted with a dogleg version with close ratios and a 1:1 ratio for fifth gear. North American models used a traditional shift pattern and had wider gear spacing with an overdriven fifth gear. A clutch-type limited-slip differential was standard equipment.\\nIn 2004, Sports Car International named the E30 M3 number six on the list of Top Sports Cars of the 1980s. In 2007, Automobile Magazine included the E30 M3 in their \"5 greatest drivers cars of all time\" under their 25 Greatest Cars of All Time.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n=== Engine ===\\nThe E30 M3 used the BMW S14 four-cylinder engine, a high-revving DOHC design with a head closely based on that of the BMW S38 six-cylinder engine and the block from the BMW M10 four-cylinder engine with a 7,250 rpm redline. In countries where the M3 was sold with a catalytic converter, the initial versions were rated at 143 kW (195 PS; 192 hp) and had a top speed of 235 km/h (146 mph). In countries where a catalytic converter was not fitted, the engine was rated at 147 kW (200 PS; 197 hp).\\n\\n\\n=== Suspension & Brakes ===\\nDifferences from the standard E30 models included:\\n\\n5-stud wheel hubs\\n225/45R16 Pirelli P700-Z tyres\\noffset control arm bushings in the front suspension, for increased caster angle\\nfront aluminium control arms introduced in 1989\\nrevised front strut tubes with bolt on kingpins and swaybar mounted to strut tube, similar to the E28 5 Series\\nfront wheel bearings and brake caliper bolt spacing from the E28 5 Series\\n280mm x 25mm vented front & 282mm x 12mm solid rear discs\\nbrake calipers similar to the E28 5 series\\n\\n\\n=== Special Editions ===\\n\\n\\n==== Evolution 1 ====\\n\\nIn 1987 an \"Evolution\" model (also called \"EVO1\") was released.

It is powered by the S55B30 engine, which is developed and engineered by BMW M GmbH. This 3.0-litre inline-6 engine has been built specifically for the new M4/M3, having a redline of 7,600 rpm with the rev limiter actuated at 7,300 rpm. The engine uses two mono-scroll turbochargers with a peak boost pressure of 18.1 psi (1.2 bar). The power is rated at 317 kW (431 PS; 425 hp), however this is achieved not at a specific engine speed, but is instead rated throughout the range of 5,500–7,300 rpm. The engine's torque is rated at 550 N⋅m (406 lbf⋅ft) throughout the range of 1,850–5,500. Two transmission choices are available, the 6-speed manual and the 7-speed M-DCT transmissions. The 7-speed M-DCT transmission accelerates the car from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.1 seconds) and the 6-speed manual transmission from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.3 seconds. The weight of the European specification M4 equipped with a manual transmission is 1,572 kg (3,466 lb) and with the M-DCT dual-clutch transmission, the car is some 40 kg (88 lb) heavier, losing some 80 kg (176 lb) as compared to the E92 M3.\\nAs per its E92 predecessor, the roof of the coupe model is constructed from carbon fiber (except if the optional sunroof is fitted). Carbon fiber is also used for the boot lid and engine brace. For the first time in a M3/M4 model, an electric power steering unit is used. The steering system is specifically tuned for both the M3 and M4, however it has been criticized for lacking in feel. The 18 inches (460 mm) and 19 inches (480 mm) wheel options are available with lightweight forged alloy wheels being standard. The M compound brakes come standard (with blue brake calipers), while carbon ceramic brakes (with gold brake calipers) are available as an option.\\nThe M4 features Active Sound, live amplification of the engine's natural sound inducted into the passenger cabin via speakers in the car. BMW claims this technology has been used so that the well insulated cabin can reduce road/wind noise but still provide the driver with the sporty sound of the M powered engine. There are no artificial sound or any pre-recorded track in the system. This system was first implemented in the M5 (F10).\\nThe M4 is based on the F32 4 Series however 50 percent of its components are unique as compared to the 4 Series.\\nThe convertible variant of the M4 was announced along with its coupe sibling, also internally known as F82 or F83 M4. It shares almost everything with the coupé version, but weighs more due to its folding metal roof. The convertible weighs 1,750 kg (3,858 lb) (manual), 1,691 kg (3,728 lb) (M-DCT). The three-piece retractable hardtop folds in 20 seconds. The only significant difference between the two is the weight due to its retractable hardtop. Like its hardtop counterpart, the F83 M4 uses carbon fiber reinforced plastic to lighten and stiffen the car.\\nBecause of its extra weight it accelerates slower, taking it 0.3 seconds longer to 100 km/h (62 mph); 4.9 seconds with the manual and 4.4 seconds with the M-DCT transmission. The dynamic differences between the two variants are marginally small.\\nStarting from the 2019 model year (production from 07/2018 onward) BMW removed the carbon fiber driveshaft so as to be abl\"),\n",

The F34 Gran Turismo fastback model continued to be available until early 2020, and was replaced by the BMW 4 Series Gran Coupé (G26) in June 2021.\\n\\n\\n== Development and launch ==\\nThe exterior designer for the F30 sedan was Christopher Weil and exterior designer for the F31 Touring was Michael de Bono.\\nThe F30 was unveiled in Munich on 14 October 2011, with market launch and first customer deliveries on 11 February 2012.\\n\\n\\n== Body styles ==\\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n=== Sedan (F30) ===\\nThe F30 sedan debuted at the 2012 Geneva Motor Show in March 2012 and was the first of the sixth generation 3 Series models to go on sale. Early models included the 328i and 335i and (post LCI) later models included the 330i and 340i. The 320i, 318d, and 316d models were added to the F30 range in March 2012. The 320i EfficientDynamics Edition and 316i were added in autumn of 2012.\\nIn the United States, the arrival of the four-cylinder models marked the first time a 3 Series was sold with a four-cylinder petrol engine, since the E36 318i of the late 1990s. The 328i xDrive and 335i xDrive went on sale in the summer of 2012.\\n\\n\\n=== Touring (F31) ===\\nThe wagon/estate body style (marketed as \"Touring\") was unveiled at the 21st Auto Mobil International held at Leipzig in 2012. This body style has a designation of F31, and the launch models consisted of the 328i, 320d and the 330d. The 320i, 316d and 318d models were added in autumn of 2012.\\n\\n\\n=== Gran Turismo (F34) ===\\nThe 5-door fastback body style has a designation of F34 and is marketed as the 3 Series Gran Turismo, with styling similar to the 5 Series Gran Turismo. The Gran Turismo body style was discontinued in 2019 for the following generation, the G20 3 Series, as it proved to be unsuccessful in terms of sales. It was effectively replaced with the 4 Series Gran Coupe.\\nAt 4,824 mm (189.9 in), the F34 is 200 mm (7.9 in) longer than the sedan and Touring models. This extra length is partly facilitated by the 110 mm (4.3 in) longer wheelbase shared with the F35 long wheelbase sedan models. The F34 is also 79 mm (3.1 in) taller than the F30/F31. These increased dimensions result in the rear wheels being located further back and lower with respect to the rear seat, and allows for three full-size rear seats.\\nThe F34 version was unveiled at the 83rd Geneva International Motor Show in March 2013. At launch, the engine range consisted of turbocharged petrol and diesel engines in straight-4 and straight-6 configurations. All-wheel drive was available in the \"i xDrive\" and \"d xDrive\" models. The F34 received a facelift (\"Life Cycle Impulse\") in mid-2016, a year after the facelift was introduced for the other body styles of the F30 generation.\\n\\n\\n=== LWB sedan (F35) ===\\nA long-wheelbase sedan mode'),\n",

It made its debut at the Amsterdam Motor Show in February 1985. It was based on the 535i chassis with various mechanical changes, most notably the M88/3 engine (shared with the E24 M635CSi grand tourer coupé) which was an updated version of the engine used in the M1 sports car. At its launch, the E28 M5 was the fastest production saloon in the world.\\n\\nThe official markets for the E28 M5 were Europe, Great Britain, the United States, Canada, and South Africa. The European and South African cars used the M88/3 engine which has a power output of 210 kW (286 PS; 282 hp).\\nCars sold in the United States and Canada used a detuned version of the M88/3 called the S38B35, which was equipped with a catalytic converter and has a power output of 191 kW (256 hp). Due to an extended production run that exceeded BMW's original forecast of production volumes, a class action lawsuit was launched by owners in the United States. The results of this class action was that owners were given a voucher for US$4,000 in 1993. Production of North American specification M5 commenced in November 1986 and ended in November 1987.\\nAside from 96 cars which were assembled in kit form at BMW's Plant in Rosslyn, South Africa, all cars were assembled by hand in Germany. Assembly took place at BMW Motorsport's plant in Preussenstrasse in Munich prior to the 1986 factory summer vacation. Thereafter, the M5 production was moved to Daimlerstrasse in Garching where the remainder were built. Production of the M5 continued until November 1988, almost a year after BMW had ceased production of regular E28 models. With a total production of 2,241 units, the E28 M5 remains among the rarest regular production BMW Motorsport cars – after the M1 (456 units), M5 (E34) Touring (891 units) and the 850CSi (1,510 units).\\n\\n\\n== E34 M5 (1988–1995) ==\\n\\nThe E34 generation of the M5 was produced from September 1988 to August 1995. Powered by the S38 straight-six engine, an evolution of the previous generation's straight-six, the E34 was initially produced in a saloon body style, with a second LHD Touring (estate/wagon) version following in 1992.\\n\\nProduction of M5 models began with the painted bodyshell of an E34 5 Series at the BMW Dingolfing plant. The shells were then transported to BMW M GmbH in Garching, where the car was assembled by hand over a period of two weeks. Only the South African M5 was entirely assembled at the Rosslyn, South Africa assembly plant from complete knock-down kits supplied from Garching, Germany. The M5 Touring, which was BMW M Division's first estate as well as the last hand-built M car, saw 891 units produced.

Other i models were expected to follow.\\nThe initial turbodiesel concept car was unveiled at the 2009 International Motor Show Germany, In 2010, BMW announced the mass production of the Vision EfficientDynamics concept in Leipzig beginning in 2013 as the BMW i8. The BMW i8 gasoline-powered concept car destined for production was unveiled at the 2011 Frankfurt Motor Show. The production version of the BMW i8 was unveiled at the 2013 International Motor Show Germany. The following are the concept and pre-production models developed by BMW that preceded the production version. When BMW i sponsored the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, they announced that they would provide support vehicles; the i8 operated as the official safety car.\\n\\n\\n=== BMW Vision EfficientDynamics (2009) ===\\n\\nThe BMW Vision EfficientDynamics was a plug-in hybrid concept car with a 1.5L three-cylinder turbo-diesel engine.

The first racing project was BMW\\'s 3.0 CSL. After this came the BMW 530MLE in 1976. It was designed to compete in South Africa\\'s Modified Production Series instead of the regular E12 528i. 100 homologated road cars had to be produced for this.\\nAfter the success of BMW M products like BMW 3.0 CSL in racing venues and the growing market for high performance sports cars, M introduced cars for sale to the public. The first official M-badged car for sale to the public was the M1, revealed at the Paris Motor Show in 1978.  The M1, however, was more of a racecar in domestic trim than an everyday driver. The direction of the M cars changed with the 1979 release of the M535i, which was a high performance version of BMW\\'s popular 5 Series mid-size sedan.\\nIn 1993, BMW Motorsport GmbH changed their name to BMW M GmbH.\\nBMW Motorsport GmbH supplied the 6.1-litre V12 DOHC 48 valve engine that powers the McLaren F1, which, like its engine supplier and manufacturer, has enjoyed plenty of racing success, famously winning the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1995, the first year of competition for the GTR racing variant.\\n\\n\\n=== Recent history ===\\nAt present, BMW M has offered modified versions of nearly every BMW nameplate, except for the Z1.\\nThe BMW X5 and X6 sport activity vehicles received M derivatives for the 2010 model year onwards. These are the first M vehicles with xDrive four-wheel drive and automatic transmissions, and also the first M-badged SUV models. However, the E70 and E71 X5 and X6 M were actually developed by BMW Group rather than by BMW M.\\nAlthough these are considered the most well known in-house tuning divisions, BMW M has a considerably different philosophy than Mercedes-AMG. BMW M has emphasized tuning only vehicles with \"Lateral agility\" (which has long been the 3 Series, 5 Series, and roadsters), while AMG has created fast versions of many of its nameplates, including flagship sedans and SUVs. Accordingly, \"an M car has to be responsive and fundamentally keen on turning as well as accelerating. The M5\\'s technical spec is all about connecting the driver to a car that reacts blindingly fast, whatever request the driver hands down.\" Until the 2010 model year, BMW M has also never used supercharging or turbocharging, unlike Mercedes-AMG or Audi; for instance the E39 and E60 iterations of the BMW M5 (using naturally-aspirated engines) competed against the Mercedes-Benz E55 AMG (with a supercharged V8) and the Audi RS6 (twin-turbo).\\nBMW M vehicles can use a variety of transmissions, including manual, dual-clutch, and automatic transmissions. The North American market E36 M3s in sedan and convertible form were the first M-vehicles offered with a traditional torque-converter automatic transmission.\\nBMW M engines were traditionally large displacement naturally aspirated high revving engines, particularly the S85 V10 in the E60 M5 and E63 M6 and the related S65 V8 in the E90 M3.

Design work by E70 X5 designer Pierre Leclercq was frozen in 2005, with test mules being run from the summer of 2005 and prototypes being tested from late 2006. Production began on December 3, 2007.\\nThe X6 marks BMW\\'s first use of its new Dynamic Performance Control system, which works in unison with xDrive all-wheel drive, both being standard on the X6. DPC is a drivetrain and chassis control system that works to regulate traction and especially correct over- and understeer by actively spreading out drive forces across the rear axle. Torque is distributed not only between the front and rear wheels (xDrive) but also from side to side at the rear, for improved agility and added stability (through the DPC rear axle). This lateral distribution of torque is commonly known as torque vectoring.\\nThe DPC differential features clutch packs on both output sides that are actuated by an electric motor. The clutch pack activates a planetary gearset which causes one wheel to be overdriven. A conventional control system will use the brakes to reduce the speed of the faster moving wheel (which is the one with less traction) and reduce engine power. This leads to increased brake wear and slower than optimal progress. The DPC system speeds up the slower moving wheel (the one with the most traction) in order to maintain stability when needed. For example; while turning, the outer wheel is overdriven to provide greater acceleration using the traction advantage through the dynamic loading of the outboard wheel in cornering. In an oversteer situation, the inner wheel is overdriven to regain traction balance.\\n\\nInitially only available with four seats, a five-seat variant was available for the 2012 model year onwards. \\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n=== X6 M ===\\n\\nIn April 2009, the X6 M version was announced, with a 408 kW (547 hp) version of the BMW S63 4.4-litre twin-turbo V8 engine.\\nThe BMW X6 M and X5 M are the first vehicles from BMW M GmbH to have xDrive all-wheel-drive system and automatic transmissions, and are also crossovers as opposed to passenger cars.

BMW i vehicles were to be sold separately from BMW or Mini. The first two production models are the BMW i3, formerly called the Mega City Vehicle (MCV), and the plug-in hybrid BMW i8, the production version of the Vision Efficient Dynamics concept unveiled at the 2009 International Motor Show Germany, which has an all-electric range of 50 kilometres (31 mi). Production of both cars was scheduled to start in Leipzig in 2013.\\nBMW incorporated lessons learned during the field testing of the Mini E (2009–2010) and the BMW ActiveE (2012) into the design of the i3, in particular the battery and powertrain, achievable range, and the use of one pedal driving in urban traffic areas.\\n\\n\\n=== Concept vehicles ===\\n\\nThe i3 concept car was unveiled at the 2011 International Motor Show. This prototype had a 22 kWh (79 MJ) lithium-ion battery pack that delivered between 130 and 160 km (80 and 100 mi). The battery fully charged in about four hours with the 240-volt charging unit. The i3 was expected to go from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in less than 8 seconds.\\nBMW also showcased a BMW i3 prototype during the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.\\n\\nBMW unveiled the i3 Concept Coupé study at the 2012 Los Angeles Auto Show. The concept car demonstrated the potential for extending the model range. The three-door hatchback coupe, like the five-door i3 electric hatchback sedan, was propelled by an electric motor developed by the BMW Group, with a maximum output of 125 kW (168 hp) and peak torque of 250 N⋅m (180 lbf⋅ft). Power delivery to the rear wheels was via a single-speed transmission. The li-ion battery pack was placed under the floor and could deliver an all-electric range of 160 km (99 mi). A 34 horsepower REX petroleum engine could be added to extend the car\\'s range to 320 km (200 mi).\\n\\n\\n=== Launch ===\\n\\nThe production i3 was announced in July 2013 as a 2014 model year vehicle.

In May 1995, the general exterior design of the E46 by Erik Goplen of DesignworksUSA was approved and as a result DesignworksUSA was contracted by BMW to work alongside BMW Group's in-house design team to create the exterior bodywork for the 3 Series range in February 1996. The design team put an emphasis on improving aerodynamics and increasing the car's aggressive stance. Design patents were filed in Germany on 16 July 1997 and in the US on 16 January 1998.\\nChris Bangle and Wolfgang Reitzle were responsible through 1995 for the production sedan's exterior, as evident in the 1997 design patent. Production development of the sedan took 24 months following design freeze and was 31 months from executive board styling approval in 1995 to its start of series production in December 1997. Erik Goplen designed the production coupé, convertible and station wagon during between 1996 and 1997. The E46 sedan was unveiled via press release on 11 November 1997 and was launched on the market at the end of April 1998 with customer deliveries.\\n\\n\\n=== Chassis ===\\nThe body shell of the E46 was claimed by BMW to be 70% more rigid than its E36 predecessor. Aluminium was used for an increased quantity of suspension components, in order to decrease unsprung mass. However, with a curb weight of 1,450 kg (3,197 lb), the E46 328ci is 55 kg (121 lb) heavier than the E36 equivalent.\\nIn tune with BMW's core values regarding handling dynamics, the E46 was initially available with a rear-wheel drive layout and a 50/50 weight distribution. All-wheel drive, which was last available in the 3 Series in 1991, was reintroduced for the E46 on the 325xi, 330xi and 330xd models.\\n\\n\\n=== Electronics ===\\nThe electronic components in the E46 are more integrated than previous generations of 3 Series, including the use of a CAN bus system. Drivetrain information (such as engine, transmission and stability control) is communicated using the CAN bus. Vehicle electronics (such as the radio, navigation, television and telecommunications) can communicate to each other via the K-bus.\\nThe E46 was the first 3 Series to be available with an engine using Valvetronic (variable valve lift). Various electronic features were also introduced to the 3 Series in the E46 generation, including satellite navigation, electronic brake-force distribution, rain-sensing wipers and LED tail-lights.\\n\\n\\n=== Production and sales ===\\nThe E46 was produced in Germany (Leipzig, Munich and Regensburg) and in South Africa (Rosslyn). Local assembly of complete knock-down (CKD) kits was used for cars sold in China, Egypt, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Thailand and Russia.\\nThe highest selling year for the E46 chassis was 2002, when 561,249 vehicles were sold worldwide.\\n\\n\\n== Body styles ==\\n\\n\\n=== Sedan ===\\n4-door sedan/saloon (E46 Sedan), produced from December 19\"),\n",
